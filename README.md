# Pygame Pong
Recreation of the hit game pong using pygame libraries.

Currently using python 3.9.6

---
Features:
- Menu Screen.
- A bad player 2 (Just moves in one direction depending on the boundary it hits).
- Random direction of travel of the ball when it hits a paddle.
- Scoring system displayed.

Future Ideas:
- Add a two player mode.
- Improve the second player in single player.
- Add an ending screen.
- Allow the ball to speed up for the length of time the rally has gone on for. (Start slow and get faster).
